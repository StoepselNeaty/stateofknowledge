  <p>In anticipation of an upcoming work task, I'm learning about Integrated Reporting, and how it can be implemented in the building sector. I'm not entirely sure what question the contract giver will give, but it's always worth having a think what it might be.</p>

<p>In the email from the contract giver, she states I'll be working on how traditional business models in the building sector need to changed in/for a more sustainable city. I suppose the implicit assumption here is that a sustainable city is one which is financially, socially and ecologically sustainable whereas a non-sustainable city is one which is financially viable but does not seek to ... And reproduce its social and natural capital.<\p>

<p>It then stands to reason that a company, be it in construction or otherwise, which happens to find itself in a sustainable city will also need to include considerations of social and natural capital stocks in its decision-making, financing and accounting. And it is this which I think my client is referring when she says I need to see how traditional business models need to be changed. She wants to know how to transition from being merely financially viable to being sustainable.<\p>

<p>Here then I'll make the assumption that she doesn't want me to look for ways

<h3>How do traditional business models in the building and construction industry need to be changed in/for a more sustainable city?<\h3>
<p>A sustainable city and by extension a company in a sustainable city is one which is financially, socially and ecologically viable in the long-term instead of being simply financially viable in the short- or medium term. It seeks to manage, replenish and reproduce its social and natural capital stocks.<\p>
<br>
<h4>How to change business models to transition a company from financially viable to sustainable?<\h4>
<br>
<p>To have a chance at answering this, I need to know:
   <ul>
     <li>what is a business model? What are its descriptive characteristics?<\li>
     <li>what do the non-sustainable business models in the construction industry look like?<\li>
     <li>what are the economic, social and ecological effects of these existing business models?<\li>
<!-- I'll leave it there for now. I can always add to it later. -->

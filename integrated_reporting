<!-- [...] vi intresserar oss [...] framförallt hur de traditionella affärsmodellen inom byggsektorn behöver förändras i den mer hållbara stadan. -->
<h3>How do traditional business models in the building and construction industry need to be changed in/for a more sustainable city?<\h3>
<p>To have a chance at answering this, I need to know:<\p>
   <ul>
     <li>what is a business model? What are its descriptive characteristics?<\li>
     <li>what do the non-sustainable business models in the construction industry look like?<\li>
     <li>what are the economic, social and ecological effects of these existing business models?<\li>
<!-- I'll leave it there for now. I can always add to it later. -->
   <\ul>
<h3>What is a business model? What are its descriptive characteristics?<\h3>
<p>The first definition I found on Wikipedia goes as follows: A business model is "an abstract representation of an organisation, be it conceptual, textual and/or graphical, of all core interrelated architectural, co-operational and financial arrangements designed and developed by an organisation presently and in the future, as well as all core products and/or services the organisation offers, or will offer, based on these arrangements that are needed to achieve its strategic goals and objectives." [1]<\p>


<p>The Wikipedia article goes on to state that "this definition indicates value proposition, value architecture, value finance and value network articulate the primary constructs or dimensions of business models. This is what I am looking for. As I state in the heading, what are its descriptive characteristics? It's the same questions as what are its 'primary constructs' or 'primary dimensions'. So these are the elements I will now look for in business models for the construction industry.<\p>

<p>The elements I'll look for are:<\p>
<ul>
   <li>value proposition;<\li>
   <li>value architecture;<\li>
   <li>value finance;<\li>
   <li>value network.<\li>
<\ul>
<p>But, of course, in order to look for them I need to know what they are, which is what I'll turn to now.<\p>
<h4>What is value proposition?<\h4>
<p>As it turns out, there's a Wikipedia article on value propositions, and to me it seems like a value proposition simply states how the organisation is going to produce value. For construction companies, I suppose this would be to ensure that the company produces buildings of a standard and attractiveness and price which sell and can be produced less for the price at which they are sold. (That all sounds rather convoluted.)<\p>

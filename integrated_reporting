<h3>How do traditional business models in the building and construction industry need to be changed in/for a more sustainable city?<\h3>
<p>A sustainable city and by extension a company in a sustainable city is one which is financially, socially and ecologically viable instead of being simply financially viable. It seeks to manage, replenish and reproduce its social and natural capital stocks.<\p>

<h4>How to change business models to transition a company from financially viable to sustainable?<\h4>

<p>It then stands to reason that a company, be it in construction or otherwise, which happens to find itself in a sustainable city will also need to include considerations of social and natural capital stocks in its decision-making, financing and accounting. And it is this which I think my client is referring when she says I need to see how traditional business models need to be changed. She wants to know how to transition from being merely financially viable to being sustainable.<\p>

<!--transition from merely financially viable to sustainable; i.e., financially, socially and ecologically viable in the long-term-->

<p>Here then I'll make the assumption that she doesn't want me to look for ways
